## Contributing guidelines

We value your contributions highly and are grateful for the effort. Here are some guidelines to help us make the most of it.

### Context matters
If you are reporting a bug, a problem, or suggesting a missing feature make sure to include details of what you experienced e.g., what happened, when and where, what you expected to happen instead, what were you trying to achieve and if applicable what device, browser, operating system were you using. Provide any detail that will help us put ourselves in your shoes and understand what you are saying or replicate the experience you are describing.

### Opinions don’t matter
We don’t care about anybody’s opinion. Everybody has one and that’s OK. Opinions are simply not an input for the product or tech work we do here. They are systematically ignored. 

### We value concrete suggestions
When you criticize an existing solution, choice or idea, make sure to propose a precise alternative. For example, saying “This button is too small” is not a valuable contribution. Saying “I suggest making the button 20% wider to have the text fit” is.

### The “why” matters
We care about why something is a problem, why you think an alternative suggestion is worth considering, why one solution might be preferable to another, etc. Before submitting your contribution double-check if you have included all the relevant whys.

### Draft pull requests
When working on a code contribution, open a draft pull request when you start working. Make sure to mention issues your code aims to resolve. When it’s ready, convert to a regular pull request.
